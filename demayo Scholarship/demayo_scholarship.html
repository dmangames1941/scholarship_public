			<h2 class="small">Introduction</h2>
			<p>Hello my name is Dalton Corriher, I am a senior in high school. I am here to talk about driving under the influence. Even though I have never been affected by someone driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, I send my prayers to those who have.</p>

			<h1>What is Driving Under the Influence?</h1>
			<p>Driving under the influence(or what I will here on out refer to as DUI) is the action of driving while you are under the influence by any sort of alcohol or drugs. DUI often impaires a drivers vision and ability to make quick decisions which is quinitessential when driving any sort of automobile or motorbike. If you get caught driving under the influence you will most of the time be jailed for a minimum of 24 hours to a rare maximum of 6 months in jails as well as be charged a fines ranging from $500 - $2000 and in some occasions be obligated to install an ignition interlock device which requires the driver to take an in car breathalizer each time before they start the car. It can also lead to the suspension of your drivers license.</p>
			<h1>Why You Should Not Drive Under the Influence</h1>
			<p>Driving under the influence is one of the most serious driving offenses next to speeding in a school zone and passing a school bus with red flashing lights on. Doing this not only puts you at risk of possibly getting killed, but in many situations it is another driver who is punished for your stupid descision. Why put you or anyone else at risk with you driving drunk when we have things like Uber and Lyft which allows you to get home safely.</p>
